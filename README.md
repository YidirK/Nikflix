## üí¨ Note
Several people have contacted me to inform me about a technique that directly blocks Netflix API, which is used to check whether you are part of the Netflix household.
However, I prefer not to use this method for two reasons:
- It doesn‚Äôt always work, and its effectiveness depends on the region.
- From a legal standpoint, my extension is less risky because we simply modify the content that has already been sent and add our own content on top. We don‚Äôt block any requests, which is legally safer. I wanted to avoid any legal issues for myself and also protect my users from being banned.
